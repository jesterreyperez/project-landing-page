# Landing Page Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal is to recreate a full landing page layout using HTML and CSS based on provided design images.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I built a complete web page layout from scratch, based on a visual design. It includes a header, multiple content sections, and a footer. While the design was provided as images (one showing layout, another showing fonts and colors), the implementation was entirely done using my own HTML and CSS.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives / Skills Gained

- Structuring a web page using semantic HTML
- Styling with CSS using:
- Flexbox
- Fonts and colors
- Backgrounds and alignment
- Descendant combinators and other CSS selectors
- Matching a visual design with code
- Practicing problem-solving and researching techniques
